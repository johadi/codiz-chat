*codiz-chat* is an application where developers chat on what they are currently doing. Make quotes for the day on what is going on in the programming atmosphere.
This application is currently under development and has no much information for now. As we progress in the application development, we will be updating the repo to reflect the workdone.
## INSTALLATION
- clone the repo
- change to the directory `cd codiz-chat`
- install required dependencies `npm install`
- Start you mongoDB on you machine
- Create `.env` file using the `env.sample` file in this project
- Fill the required fields in the `.env` file
- Run the server side which is using express server separately with `npm run server`
- Run the client side which is using webpack-dev-server with `npm run build:dev`
- Navigate to the api link using `localhost:5000/api`
- Navigate to the client side link with `localhost:8080`
- You can decide to run everything at once with `npm run build`. This command puts the application in the development mode

More Update on this Repo coming soon.
